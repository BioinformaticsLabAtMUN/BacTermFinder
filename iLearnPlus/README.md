# *iLearnPlus*: a comprehensive and automated machine-learning platform for nucleic acid and protein sequence analysis, prediction and visualization. 

## Introduction
*iLearnPlus* is the first machine-learning platform with both graphical- and web-based user interface that enables the construction of automated machine-learning pipelines for computational analysis and predictions using nucleic acid and protein sequences. *iLearnPlus* integrates 21 machine-learning algorithms (including 12 conventional classification algorithms, two ensemble-learning frameworks and seven deep-learning approaches) and 19 major sequence encoding schemes (in total 147 feature descriptors), outnumbering all the current web servers and stand-alone tools for biological sequence analysis, to the best of our knowledge. In addition, the friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface) of *iLearnPlus* is available to biologists to conduct their analyses smoothly, significantly increasing the effectiveness and user experience compared to the existing pipelines. iLearnPlus is an open-source platform for academic purposes and is available at https://github.com/Superzchen/iLearnPlus/. The iLearnPlus-Basic module is online accessible at http://ilearnplus.erc.monash.edu/.

## Methods
Four major modules, including *iLearnPlus-Basic*, *iLearnPlus-Estimator*, *iLearnPlus-AutoML*, and *iLearnPlus-LoadModel*, are provided in *iLearnPlus* for biologists and bioinformaticians to conduct customizable sequence-based feature engineering and analysis, machine-learning algorithm construction, performance assessment, statistical analysis, and data visualization, without additional programming.![iLearnPlus](https://github.com/Superzchen/iLearnPlus/blob/main/images/Architecture.png )

## Application example
### Identification of lysine crotonylation site
#### Estimate the performance of multiple feature descriptors using *iLearnPlus-Estimator* module
Here, the *iLearnPlus-Estimator* module was used to comparatively assess the performance of different feature sets. We used the *iLearnPlus-Estimator* module in the standalone GUI version to load the data, produced seven feature sets (AAC, EAAC, EGAAC, DDE, binary, ZScale, and BLOSUM) and selected a machine-learning algorithm, the random forest algorithm (with the default setting of 1000 trees) to construct the classifier via 10-fold cross-validation. This analysis reveals that the model built utilizing the EGAAC feature descriptors achieved the best performance.

#### Estimate the performance multiple ML algorithms using *iLearnPlus-AutoML* module
Then, the *iLearnPlus-AutoML* module to comparatively evaluate the predictive performance across seven machine-learning algorithms: SGD, LR, XGBoost, LightGBM, RF, MLP, and CNN. We used the bootstrap tests to assess statistical significance of the differences between the ROC curves produced by these algorithms.
  
![Case study](https://github.com/Superzchen/iLearnPlus/blob/main/images/Case_2.png)
  
The result shows that the deep-learning model, CNN, achieved the best predictive performance among all the seven machine-learning algorithms, with Acc=85.4% and AUC=0.823.
  
#### Dataset download
