# BacTermData: Experimentally Verified Bacteria Terminators

## Description of directories

This directory contains BacTermData which is a compilation of experimentally verified bacteria gathered from literature.

In **Bacteria** directory, there are directories for each study. The directory names are the PubMed Central Codes (PMC) and they are not duplicated bacteria. 

In **Duplicated** directory, we have bacteria that we had more than study done on them, and we had to deduplicate the terminator files and/or merge the terminator locations if necessary.

In **Other** directory, there are to archeae terminator studies that we used for testing generalization of our BacTermFinder model.
